 Utilities
===========

Various more-or-less useful utilities and tools.

## hexd
  hexd prints a human-readable hexdump of the specified files, or standard
  input if omitted.  Its main distinguishing feature is the use of colours to
  visually indicate which range of values an octet belongs to, aiding in
  spotting patterns in binary data.

## plaintext
  A simple filter that strips all CSI control sequences from stdin.  This
  includes SGR formatting as well as other terminal control codes.
